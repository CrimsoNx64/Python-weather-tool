# Python-weather-tool

This is a python weather tool using pyowm API wrapper which uses OpenWeatherMap
In order for this to work, youll need to download and install the required libraries 
Youll also need to get an API key from OpenWeatherMap, you can do this for free

The place is set to London, GB and London timezone by default. This can be changed in the beginning lines of the source code

The tool has a basic GUI which cleanly shows the place, local time, and weather statistics

This code can easily be intergrated into a larger project, or you can just use it to monitor the weather of an area

Have fun!!
